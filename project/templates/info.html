    <h1>Data on the Whole 30</h1>
    <p>When deciding to start the Whole 30 I did what a great deal of people probably do I
    looked at some informational websites and I took into account the testimonials of others that
  had done the program.  I felt fairly confident that going through the Whole 30 would be good for 
  , at the time I was also studying some data science and I thought that maybe I could use some of the tools that
  I was learning to analyze people self reported Whole 30 results and maybe find some unique conclusions about the Whole 30.
<<br>
I was studying Flask so I decided to build a webpage that using flask that would connect to a SQL database.  I could then
attach a survey that would gather information from Whole 30 pratictioners and hopefully after getting some responses I will be able
to conduct some machine learning to make predictions about what to expect on the whole 30.  I also wanted to get some written observations
to practice some Natural Language Processing.
<br>
Currently, the website does not nave a great user feel as I was concerned mostly with the backend.  In the future I hope to make the
website more user friendly as well as add a dashboard to summarize results generated from the database.  Right now you have to be a member to take the survey,
but you do not have to provide a valid email to register.  All that is required is that the email has the @ sign and is unique.
